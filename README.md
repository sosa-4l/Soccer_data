This is a data pipeline to extract  and transform soccer players statistics(and eventually clubs) data from the "https://v3.football.api-sports.io/players" api using python.

The data is then stored on a Postgresql database

This database is then conected to Power Bi for Visualization and Analysis

All this is orchestrated daily using Apache Airflow,
And (Soon to be) Containerized Using Docker

Have Fun Reviewing the Code
